I asked, 'Where is the Auth logic handle?' and it didn't just guess—it pointed me to the exact file and lines, referencing the specific functions. It understands context better than Copilot.</p><h3>The Verdict</h3><p>For me, this replaced VS Code entirely. It's not just a tool; it's a new way of working.

It feels like magic. It's ControlNet made accessible to everyone.</p><h3>Best Feature: Real-time generation</h3><p>It's fast. You don't need a GPU/computer to run it. It runs in the browser and gives you instant gratification. It's the perfect demo to show friends what AI can do.</p><h3>The Verdict</h3><p>It's more of a toy than a professional tool, but it's an incredibly fun toy. Great for brainstorming composition or just messing around.</p>",

        "fullReview": "<h3>First Impressions</h3><p>This is Pictionary with an AI. I was asked to draw a 'camel', and as I drew the humps, the AI shouted 'Mountain! Cloud! Camel!'. It's addictive. I played for 20 minutes straight trying to beat the timer.</p><h3>Best Feature: The Data Viz</h3><p>After the game, it shows you how other people drew the same object. It's fascinating to see how the world visualizes a 'chair' or 'clock'. It's a crowd-sourced lesson in design.</p><h3>The Verdict</h3><p>It's a classic. Built by Google Creative Lab, it's one of the best examples of gamified AI. Simple, educational, and fun.</p>",
