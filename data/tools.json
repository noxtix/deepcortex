        "fullReview": "<h2>What is Cursor?</h2><p>Cursor is not just another plugin; it is a full-fledged <strong>fork of VS Code</strong> designed from the ground up to pair-program with you. Imagine VS Code, but with an AI that understands your entire codebase, can refactor entire files, and even fix terminal errors with a single click. For students and junior developers, it reduces the barrier to entry significantly.</p><h2>Key Features</h2><ul><li><strong>Chat with Codebase:</strong> Unlike ChatGPT which only knows what you paste, Cursor indexes your workspace. You can ask, &quot;Where is the auth logic defined?&quot; and it will point you to the exact file.</li><li><strong>Auto-Debug:</strong> When your terminal throws an error, a new &quot;Auto-Debug&quot; button appears. Click it, and Cursor analyzes the stack trace and suggests a fix instantly.</li><li><strong>Copilot++:</strong> This feature predicts your next edit, not just the next word. It allows for extremely fast implementation of boilerplate code.</li></ul><h2>Is the Pro Plan worth it?</h2><p>Access to the basic features is free, but the Pro plan ($20/mo) unlocks the faster GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models. For professional developers, the time saved in debugging alone justifies the cost. For students, the free tier is generous enough to get started.</p><h2>The Verdict</h2><p>Cursor is currently the <strong>gold standard</strong> for AI coding environments. It feels native, fast, and remarkably intelligent. If you are starting a new project in 2025, you should be using Cursor.</p>",
