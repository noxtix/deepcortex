Being a student in 2025 is tough. The reading lists are longer, the deadlines are shorter, and the expectations are higher.

But you have a secret weapon: **AI**.

We tried 50+ tools to find the ones that actually help you learn, rather than just doing the work for you. Here are the top 3.

## 1. Cursor (For CS Students)

If you are learning to code, you need to stop using vanilla VS Code. Cursor is an AI-powered editor that explains *why* your code is broken, not just *how* to fix it.

It's like having a TA sitting next to you 24/7.

## 2. Consensus (For Research)

Forget Google Scholar. Consensus is a search engine that uses AI to find answers in actual scientific papers. If you ask "Does caffeine improve memory?", it reads 10 papers and summarizes the scientific consensus for you.

## 3. Notion (For Organization)

The classic. With the new Notion AI features, you can turn your messy lecture notes into clean summaries and flashcards instantly.

## Conclusion

Don't let the tech overwhelm you. Pick one of these tools and start using it today. Your GPA will thank you.
